                Teak and Twine made the gift giving for our company so easy!
                They had multiple examples to show me which helped in narrowing
                our price point and choosing what items we wanted in our box. My
                account manager (Christina) was very helpful and timely in her
                responses. The design team took elements from our website and
                really made our branding look and feel like us. We will
                definitely use Teak and Twine again in the future!
